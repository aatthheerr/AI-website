<h3>Types of artificial intelligence:</h3>
<br><br>
 
     <table border="1" width="100%"> 
<tr> 
    <th class="w">Narrow artificial intelligence</th> 
    <th>It is artificial intelligence that specializes in one field. For example, there are AIs that can beat a world chess champion, which is the only thing they do.</th> 
</tr> 
<tr> 
    <th class="w">General artificial intelligence</th> 
    <th>This type refers to computers that have human-level intelligence in all fields, that is, they can perform any intellectual task that a human can perform. Creating this type of intelligence is much more difficult than the previous type, and we have not reached that level yet.</th> 
</tr> 
<tr> 
    <th class="w">Super artificial intelligence</th> 
    <th>Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom defines superintelligence as “thinking more intelligently than the best human minds in almost every domain, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills,” which is why the field of artificial intelligence is such an interesting field.</th>
